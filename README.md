I am currently a lecturer at the PUCRS University teaching mostly automation, manufacturing,
and engineering design courses. Together with that, I also work as a technician for the IDEIA,
which is a center for supporting science and technology development for the same university.
PUCRS is located in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil.

I am a graduated Control and Automation Engineer with a MasterÂ´s degree in Computer Science,
having more than 20 years of experience working with software development, Linux-based servers,
and database management. And I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Material Sciences.

Specialties: Systems integration, heterogeneous networks, development and administration
of SQL databases (specially PostgreSQL and Oracle). General automation, computer vision,
robotics, manufacturing systems, CAD (specially Pro/Engineer) 

And finally, I've just discoverd this special github feature in which the README.md file of a
repository named after your username will render as your profile readm file.
