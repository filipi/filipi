I am currently a lecturer at the PUCRS University teaching mostly automation, manufacturing,
and engineering design courses. Together with that, I also work as a technician for the IDEIA,
which is a center for supporting science and technology development for the same university.
PUCRS is located in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil.

I am a graduated Control and Automation Engineer with a Master´s degree in Computer Science,
having more than 20 years of experience working with software development, Linux-based servers,
and database management. And I also have a Ph.D. degree in Material Sciences.

Specialties: Systems integration, heterogeneous networks, development and administration
of SQL databases (specially PostgreSQL and Oracle). General automation, computer vision,
robotics, manufacturing systems, CAD (specially PTC Creo Parametric) 

And finally, I've just discoverd this special github feature in which the README.md file of a
repository named after your username will render as your profile readme file.
